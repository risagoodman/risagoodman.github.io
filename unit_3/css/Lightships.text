Imagine this:  You are out on the sea at night, prt of ship s crew about the size of a beefy tour bus.  The ship is anchored out there on two opposing anchors, pulled tught like a hammock.  On the mast is an enormous light.  Every thirty seconds or so a horn blares.  All night long.  Maybe into the day.  I don't know about you but being on floating morothome packed in with the crew, with a spinning light and a ahorn blaring every thirty seconds would set my nerves on fire.
